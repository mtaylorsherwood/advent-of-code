# Advent of Code

Repository for my attempts at the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

Aiming to do better than halfway through day three in 2021.

## Time Tracking

For a bit of fun, how long did these take to solve. Started tracking on day four using the build in task time tracker within IntelliJ.

All times in minutes.

| Day   | Puzzle One | Puzzle Two | Notes                                                                                          |

| Four  |     30     |     3      | I'd done the hard work for the first puzzle, I feel they should have been the other way around |
